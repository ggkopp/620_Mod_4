"21 ContributorsS.T.P. Lyrics[Chorus]\nAll that I need\nLook at all the love we found, oh-oh\nI won't run and pull no one jack move\nThey love us for the Kingston sound, oh-oh\n\n[Verse 1]\nFlava Flav and I.C.E\nOnce said somethin' that made me\nWant to burn my liquor store down to the ground\nBut I just can't leave the pad\n'Cause I'll surely wind up dead\n'Cause I know they're out there waiting and watching for me\nStill, I got my yellow cat\nAnd my wooden baseball bat\nAnd my shiny silver gat, and if my homie got my back\nThen I've got\n\n[Chorus]\nAll that I need\nLook at all the love we've found, oh-oh\nI won't run and pull a one jack move\nThey love us for the Kingston sound, oh-oh\n\n[Bridge]\nOh, oh-oh\nI won't slip and I won't trip\nSend Matt Vargas to regrip\nWhile I'm wrenchin' on my ride\nIn that secret pad where we hide\nThere's always lots of fun stuff to do\nLike relax and design a brand new tattoo\nPlayin' with my crossword puzzle book\nI'm even learnin' how to cook\nYou might also like[Verse 2]\nHave you seen that little whore, Betty?\nSomeone said that she stole my freddie\nAnd if she made off with my last clean rig\nI'm going to kill that fuckin' ditch pig, so what?\nOutta my, outta my, outta my, outta my secret pad\n'Cause I know you're talkin' about me, makin' it hard to live\n'Cause I don't want no money fee, don't want no money down\nMy secret tweaker pad is now the hottest dope spot in town\nI just take it nice and easy\nDon't want no sheriff breakin' down the door to raid me\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause all that I need\nLook at all the love we've found, oh-oh\nI won't run and pull the one jack move\nThey love her for the Kingston sound, oh-oh\n\n[Outro]\nBaby, you wanna give me kisses sweet\nOnly for a night, with no repeat\nBaby, you wanna leave and never call\nOh, but the taste of honey is worse than none at all5Embed"
